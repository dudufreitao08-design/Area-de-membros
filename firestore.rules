/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Aether Academy.
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and progress,
 *                  while allowing public read access to module information.
 *
 * @data_structure User data is stored under /users/{userId}, and user progress is stored under
 *                 /users/{userId}/progress/{progressId}. Module data is stored under /modules/{moduleId}.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - Users can only access their own profile and progress data.
 *   - Module data is publicly readable.
 *   - Listing users is not allowed.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization N/A. Path-based ownership is used.
 * @structural_segregation User progress data is stored in a subcollection of the user's document.
